Weather Application
 Small mock-up project detailing on eventListeners and DOM events, finding HTML elements and using CSS for styling.

The weather uses current weatherdata api from OpenWeatherMap and it has its own api key and api url

Basically, it shows the current weather temperature of cities around the world.


Developing an app providing accurate and up-to-date weather information using the current weather data API (https://openweathermap.org/current).

Unreliable weather update sources

The benefits: 
Convenience. Easy access to accurate weather information

User-friendly. Intuitive interface for all users

Real-time Data. Instant updates with data retrieved from a reliable source.
